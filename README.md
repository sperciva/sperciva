- 👋 Hi, I’m Sarah Percival
- 👀 I’m interested in applied and theoretical problems in computational topology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the Euler Characteristic Transform, as well as trying to improve my Python skills.
- 💞️ Within the next few months, I'd like to start a collaboration involving applying topological data analysis to issues related to social justice.
- 📫 You can email me at perciva9 at msu dot edu.
